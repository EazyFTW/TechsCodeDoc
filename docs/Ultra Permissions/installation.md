# Installation

Ultra Permissions can be used for a single Minecraft Server as well as for multiple. If you are planning on syncing permissions you will need to have a MySQL Database.

## Regular Install

!!! tip
    You used a different Permissions Plugin before? Ultra Permissions allows you to [migrate](http://new.techsco.de/Ultra%20Permissions/migrate/) your existing data!

Drop your `UltraPermissions.jar` into your plugins directory and restart your server.

To use Ultra Permissions you will need to make yourself a **Super Admin**.
This can be done by typing in `upc addSuperAdmin <Your Name>` via the console.

You should now be able to open the GUI with `/uperms`

## Network Install
